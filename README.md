<h1>Python Project for Data Engineering</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project i extracted data from multiple file formats, transformed it into specific datatypes, and then loaded it into a single source for analysis. I also implemented web scraping and extracted data with API's. At the end of this project i was able to gain confidence in working with large datasets.
